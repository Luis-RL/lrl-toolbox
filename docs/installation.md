# Installation

## Stable release

To install LRL Toolbox, run this command in your
terminal:

``` console
$ pip install lrl-toolbox
```

This is the preferred method to install LRL Toolbox, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for LRL Toolbox can be downloaded from
the [Github repo][].

You can either clone the public repository:

``` console
$ git clone git://github.com/Luis-RL/lrl-toolbox
```

Or download the [tarball][]:

``` console
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/Luis-RL/lrl-toolbox/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

``` console
$ pip install .
```
